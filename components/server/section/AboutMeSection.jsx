              My name is Taha SÃ¶kmen, and I am a passionate developer who finds
              joy in creating and witnessing the functionality of the code I
              write. With a strong background in development, I have gained
              extensive experience in building a wide range of applications and
              games, ranging from desktop to mobile platforms.
              <br />
              <br />
              While I initially specialized in using the Unity game engine for
              game development, which allowed me to master the C# programming
              language, I have since broadened my skill set to include web
              design. During my internship, I had the opportunity to work
              specifically in web design, honing my skills in creating visually
              appealing and user-friendly websites. I am proficient in HTML and
              CSS, and I continue to explore and expand my knowledge in this
              area.
              <br />
              <br />
              Combining my passion for coding, my proficiency in various
              programming languages, and my curiosity for emerging technologies,
              I am always seeking new opportunities to contribute to innovative
              projects and expand my skill set.
